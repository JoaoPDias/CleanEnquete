# **Clean Survey**

## [**Course Link**](https://www.udemy.com/course/tdd-com-mango/?referralCode=B53CE5CA2B9AFA5A6FA1)



This API that I am creating is a learning experience obtained in the course applied by professor Rodrigo Manguinho at Udemy.

A great course that seeks to demonstrate in depth all stages of development ,continuous Deployment, continuous integration and continuous delivery

The objective of the training is to show how to create an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD as the working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID and, whenever possible, applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
